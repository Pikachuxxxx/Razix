Game idea: Help me bring shape to this

The game has 2 parallel track the smaller track that happes very once in a while...

The main track:
A whore in a whore house one day goes to a carnival with her girl friends and buys a gun and this carnival has all kinds of stalls to help women learn all 66 skills as described in kamasurtra (crypto maths, cooking etc.) she learns how to solve crypto and then smokes some weed and falls into a boss level and learns about her powers that her clothes cna help fend off evil also she finds a crypto vienere cipher from a guy and solves and goes on a journer yo find her true self and the boy

In this journely she gights off evil and also searches for clues to get closed to the boy by solving puzzles

The actual puzzles comes from a alternative timeline where a boy makes it, idk how she gets it thought and how that girl dreams of her battles in her sleep and gets curious about her and gives cluies to find her and fight off better this is the gfoal of the game

Now she also goes on top of moundatines and etc and all and kills the mamasan goons and frees of her girlfriends and the carnival helps her get more skills and boss fights and puzzles agains

Give structure to this and design episode n and boss fight and parallel tracks, don't use points just paragraphcs stc. and help me make the clothes powers game mechanics as core and fun and write the abstract of the story first in a simple GDD 

Tanu, a girl trapped in a house she doesn’t belong to, goes to a carnival and learns ciphers. One night she decodes a strange letter from a boy and starts dreaming his memories. She also finds her clothes react to her emotions protecting her, changing shape, glowing. She fights dream monsters that guard pieces of truth about the boy. Each boss she kills opens new dreams and puzzles that help her see more of him and herself.

Dream World:

Boss → cipher clue → power upgrade → vision of the boy.

Real World:

Explore → talk → learn → small puzzles → smoke/sleep → dream.

Episode 1 – The Carnival Night
Tanu and her girlfriends sneak out to the carnival.
They attend a small lecture where a man teaches women secret cipher writing.
She buys an old gun from a strange stall.
That night she smokes and falls into a dream.

Boss Fight 1 – Nanku's Song

Dream opens in a spinning carnival made of cloth and sound.
A singing spirit (Nanku’s echo) attacks with rhythmic waves.
She fights using pure instinct - her clothes move on their own, wrapping her, blocking attacks.
After the fight she finds the first cipher fragment with a mark of a cave and a mountain.
Power unlocked: Cloth defense and light reflection (blocks hits automatically).

Episode 2 – The Cave and the Attack
She follows the cipher symbol to a nearby cave. Inside, she finds strange markings - same as the cipher language.
Here she learns more about the boy - that he too once came to the carnival, learning secret knowledge before vanishing.
Her clothes react to symbols on the walls, glowing brighter. She realizes they carry some ancient energy tied to her bloodline.
Before she can leave, the mamasan’s goons find her.
They corner her outside the cave. She’s hurt, hides, and then faints.

Boss Fight 2 – Dream of the Goons

In dream state, the goons appear as monstrous shadows stitched together.
She uses her new cloth powers - the dream version of herself fights back, turning her dress into blades and whips.
When she wakes up, the goons are dead - their bodies tangled in real cloth threads.
Power evolved: Cloth attack mode (turns into tendrils for counter and strike).
She realizes she can use her dream self to affect the real world.
