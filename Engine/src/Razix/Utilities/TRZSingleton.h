/**
 * When we define a template function or class, the compiler only generates code for it when it's actually used.
 * That works fine when everything is in a header file, but if we move the definition to a `.cpp` file,
 * the linker needs to know where to find it. Otherwise, we get those annoying "undefined symbol" errors.
 *
 * To fix that, we explicitly instantiate the template in the `.cpp` file like this:
 *
 *     template class RZSingleton<RZResourceManager>;
 *
 * This tells the compiler, "Hey, generate the code for `RZSingleton<RZResourceManager>` right here."
 * That way, any translation unit that includes the header can just link against this definition instead of
 * trying to create its own.
 *
 * This is especially important when working with DLLs because if we donâ€™t do this,
 * both the EXE and DLL will end up creating their own separate instances of `RZSingleton<RZResourceManager>`,
 * which totally breaks the whole singleton pattern. Which is why we hide the Get implementation in .cpp and define
 * a template class RZSingleton<T>; for each type of the singleton we use to maintain a single copy.
 * This is a bit of manual work at the cost of functionality which is fine.
