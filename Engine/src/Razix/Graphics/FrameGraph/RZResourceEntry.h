             * Type Erasure class to hold different types of Graphics API resources using a wrapped class under one umbrella
             * 
             * So instead of calling a interface we use types to resolve the implementation and call stuff
             * 
             * Of course we can have this common IRZResource<T> and not have an entry point, but we don't have a common handle for all resources, 
             * this is not possible and we don't encourage storing IRZResources* anywhere except in a Pool (Transient in this case) and also 
             * anything other than the Graphics API can only interact via Handles! and it will get messy even if we do so!
             * Graphics API is always DECOUPLED from anything else, it's fixed!!!
             * 
             * Think like this, the Graphics API classes are itself polymorphic, now again enforcing rules on those interfaces restricts how 
             * they are created, this way we have minimal rules from the TypeErasure concept so decoupling is necessary and also we have reached
             * the upper limit of combining under a single type for Graphics API
             * 
             * This is why the T passes as resource is neither directly the Graphics API nor is just the Handle<U> because by itself it's of no use
             * Hence we have wrappers around Handle<U> and pass that wrapper FrameGraphTResource as T to the EntryPoint class
