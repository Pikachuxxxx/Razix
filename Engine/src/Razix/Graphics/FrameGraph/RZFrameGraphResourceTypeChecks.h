             * We need ways to emulate pure virtual function verification
             * We use SFINAE idiom and type traits as the base concept to do this 
             * 
             * Core Concept : SFINAE failure trigger redirection
             * 
             * SFINAE also does Struct/Type verification in addition to functions exist checks
             * 
             * SFINAE using safe substitution failure we manually trigger based on condition to choose the test we want 
             * and create only those template specialization overload sets that conform the pattern we want
             * 
             * Note: These check don't consider the function signature for now
             * 
             * Note: We can do return type checks specialization inside the functions instead 
             * of just returning{}
             * 
             * Note: For more info on how these macros work read RZCore.h
