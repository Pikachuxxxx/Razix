Bonjour installers
------------------
Bonjour is required to be installed for the Wws.LiveConnect.dll to work.
Bonjour.msi is the installer for 32-bit versions of Windows.
Bonjour64.msi is the installer for 64-bit versions of Windows.
Downloading and installing iTunes is probably the easiest way to install Bonjour.

If you have access to the WWS SDK, you can find the Bonjour installers in wws_atf\NoDistro\ThirdParty\Wws.LiveConnect.

Wws.LiveConnect.dll was created by the Game Tech Group within Tools And Technology in SCEA. The Authoring Tools Framework team could develop redistributable binaries that do not require the Bonjour.msi or Bounjour64.msi installers, upon request.
